    How might we improve the patient journey with prescription medications? Let’s rethink the way people access their pharmaceuticals and give help to those who really need it.

    During this project, I collaborated with a team of fellow MADI students to ideate improvements to the patient journey with prescription medications. Over the course of our primary research and interviewing sessions, we realized that price transparency and diminishing trust in the pharmaceutical system had pushed patients into a corner.  Through further ideation, we landed on a two-part solution.

    Firstly, my team and I created a suite of print materials to be displayed and distributed in the doctor’s office. The information and prompts in these graphics allowed for patients to be more empowered in their discussions with medical staff. We found a huge impact in bettering the prescription journey by helping patients to ask the right questions to their doctors.

    Next, we wanted to bring price transparency to patients while they still had the option to discuss alternatives with their doctors. I coded a prototype of the system required in Python, utilizing the previous database collected by our client, RefillWise. The system allows for users to text in the name of a medication (“Lipitor” for the prototype) and receive information on its pricing and that of the comparable generics.

    I urge you to try it yourself! Text “LIPITOR” to (214) 214 - 4367.
