  intro: |
    In 1962, the famed Castiglioni brothers first designed and produced the Arco Floor Lamp. Since it's inception, the Arco Floor Lamp has become an icon of high-fashion and intensely detailed product design. Made with a Carrara marble base and a stainless steel arm, it's no wonder that the lamp currently runs $3,000.

    In 2016, I gave it a shot.

			My lamp was modeled after the <a href="https://usa.flos.com/modern-floor-lamps/arco">Arco Floor Lamp</a>, and I was tasked to reimagine the product as a study towards the form and composition of designed objects. 
			<br>
			<br>
			It weighs approximately 160 lbs and is made out of cement, wood, and mixing bowls from IKEA. Net cost for fabrication of the final product was around $200. I used a variety of tools and equipment from the makerspace at my university to create the lamp.

			The shade is, surprisinglyn, just two IKEA mixing bowls. I had originally planned to weld the two bowls together, but I realized that clear packing tape affixed on the inside actually provided the same security without marring the stainless steel. By avoiding welding, the end result was far cleaner than I had anticipated.

		<div class="reduced-size-on-desktop-container-double">
			I cast the counterweight out of Quickrete expansion cement. The PVC was not supposed to stay in there, but I did not lubricate that section enough. As cement dries, it also expands. The pressure of the expanded cement has locked the tube into place, and I have chosen to avoid ripping it out to prevent damaging the base. As of now, the PVC will forever be trapped in the cement. 
			<br><br>
			Based on the original design insights, the through hole allows for two adults to stick a broomstick inside the opening and use that to lift up the very heavy base. The base itself weighs around 140 lbs.

			Finding dimensions for sketching and planning was difficult, as very few of the schematics were available online. I was able to work with Design Within Reach to study their real Arco Floor Lamp and record more data for my design. 
			<br><br>
			A real Arco Floor Lamp is made out of Carrara marble from Carrara, Italy. This marble is quite expensive, especially so given the budget of a struggling graduate student. For this reason, I chose to swap the marble with expanding cement. 
			<br><br>
			Notice that the through hole exists in the real Arco as well as my replica.

		<div class="reduced-size-on-desktop-container-double">
			I built the mold over the course of a few days. The buttresses were added to accommodate for the stress and pressure of the expansion cement as it cures. Prior to pouring the cement, I lubricated the insides of the mold with a release that would allow me to cleanly separate away the end product.
			<br><br>
			The contraption that I am holding in this photo was created to provide support for the cement once it sets. It is comprised of metal dowels holding up chicken wire mesh that were tied to strings. The whole unit hung into the mold with none of these objects touching the sides. I did not want to have any metal points sticking out from the sides after I had casted it, so everything needed to be suspended in the center of the cement.

		<div class="reduced-size-on-desktop-container-double">
			I poured the cement with the assistance of a few friends. In mixing and pouring, timing is key. The ratio of water is key in creating a functional slurry. We repeatedly mixed, poured, and tapped to remove as many air bubbles as possible. The process was long and grueling, but the reward was well worth the effort.

			The IKEA bowls. I used a circle saw to cut them down with the help of the assistant director of SMU's makerspace. Lots of sparks flew when these were cut.
			<br><br>
			After cutting, I used a sander to finish down the edges and a dremel to do the fine softening.
			<br><br>
			I had spent a very long time attempting to find the perfect shade material, and IKEA bowls actually worked perfectly to fulfill this goal. They were cheap, durable, and relatively easy to machine once I had acquired the tools to do so. All in all, I am very happy with the choices I made in selecting materials.
