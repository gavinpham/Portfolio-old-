  intro: |
    In some low-income areas of South Dallas, roaming dogs have threatened the safety of locals. However, many of these dogs are only loose due to the behavior of their owners. To push the point even further, these behaviors are culturally ingrained within the community. What points of intervention exist in this space, and how do we design for the community instead of against it?

For the capstone of my graduate program, myself and a team of fellow grad students have been tasked with a rather large question:

"How might we improve dog ownership in South Dallas?"

In 2016, a woman was mauled to death by a pack of loose dogs. This happened in the heart of Dallas, only a few miles away from the Texas State Fairgrounds. Since then, the city has made great progress in reducing the numbers of roaming dogs through intense spaying and neutering campaigns. 

As an additive study to help reduce the chance of another attack, my graduate program was brought onto the case to look a the issue from the human side. This project is a collaboration between our main client, _The Communities Foundation of Texas_, and a variety of other organizations in Dallas. Various branches of the SPCA of Texas and Dallas Animal Services have played a huge role in assisting us with interview leads, research opportunities, and raw data. 

The project itself is ongoing. My team and I are about halfway through the human-centered design process. We have just recently begun prototyping. If you would like to learn more about our ongoing study, please feel free to contact me at [gpham@smu.edu](mailto:gpham@smu.edu).

My team and I recently presented a presentation that summed up our design research. [Click here to view the PDF slide deck](http://www.gavinpham.com/assets/slides/South-Dallas-Dogs.pdf).
