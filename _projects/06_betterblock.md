  intro: |
    Gentrification is a huge issue in the United States, especially so in Dallas. One facet of this issue is the lack of minority representation in architecture and city planning. 

    The Better Block Foundation is working to improve this relationship through a fellowship program, of which I had the pleasure to assist in brand development.

Under the creative direction of Justin Childress of [Switch Creative](https://switch.is/), myself and another graduate student took charge in a rebrand for the Better Block Fellowship Program. 

For more details on the study as well as information on my work towards its completion, please get in touch with me at [gpham@smu.edu](mailto:gpham@smu.edu). The program has not yet been rolled out, and thus its contents are still a bit hushed.
