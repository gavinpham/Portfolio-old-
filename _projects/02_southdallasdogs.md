  intro: |
    In some low-income areas of South Dallas, roaming dogs have threatened the safety of locals. However, many of these dogs are only loose due to the behavior of their owners. After thorough research of the community, it turns out that a few dog owners have a disproportionate impact on the loose dog problem in South Dallas. How might we design for these high-impact users?

Throughout this project, my team and I discovered the users with the most need and delivered the information needed to correct their harmful behaviors.

In 2016, a woman was killed by a pack of roaming dogs in South Dallas. This project began as a cooperative effort of animal organizations to address the human behaviors that contributed to the loose dog population. __My team and I exposed several harmful behaviors through 45 first-person interviews.__ While prototyping, we ran into a new issue: none of the dog owners who were compliant with testing seemed to be part of the problem. However, these participants would point to a house down the street that was. According to these participants, there were a few owners who contributed the most to the loose dog issue. We attempted to reach out to them, but each incident resulted in a dead end or a door shut in our face. We needed to refine our approach. 

I found what my team needed through Dallas OpenData, a freely accessible repository of public data in Dallas County. Reports from Dallas Animal Services contained thousands of entries detailing bites, attacks, and citations given for loose and roaming dogs. __By filtering the raw data for homes with multiple loose dog citations, I generated a list of 37 verified “high-impact” dog owners.__

So, we decided to flip our system. __We couldn’t expect these users to voluntarily come to us, we needed to go to them.__ Our solution took the form of a mailed package of dog food and carefully worded information cards. __The DogBox__ addressed inaccurate and harmful beliefs to create positive behavior change. More than an educational campaign, it was a carefully designed experience that created an opportunity for new information to be received amicably by a high-impact user. 

The SPCA is currently overlooking an implementation of the system at scale using the following design principles:

___Aim for the user with the most need instead of the user who is most willing.___

___Create an easy to engage experience for people who have other burdens.___

___Focus on behavior by gently correcting misconceptions.___

___Include what the community considers to be most important.___
