    Published in 2017, myself and a team of fellow undergraduates demonstrate the value of a greedy approach to hierarchical network topologies.

#### Abstract

In this paper, my team and I present a greedy approach to create hierarchical network topologies for throughput optimization in single access point to create hierarchical network topologies. By minimizing electromagnetic interference, we optimize throughput by creating topologies where the probability of a collision occurring is low. We evaluate a series of greedy topology algorithms based on the average throughput of the resulting network. We conclude that hierarchical network topologies generated with greedy algorithms significantly outperform networks with simple star topologies by up to 75%.

#### TL;DR

Our proposed system makes WIFI significantly better in comparison to the standard setup.
