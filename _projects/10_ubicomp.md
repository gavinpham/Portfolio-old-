    Is it possible to teach elementary schoolchildren about computer science principles? What if the teacher doesn't have access to a computer? What if the school is in Indonesia? 

    It is possible, and my team did it.

#### The Problem

[Ubiquitous computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubiquitous_computing) is fueled by engineers who desire to innovate and improve the world around them. Education of basic computer science principles is the most direct way to plant that seed of curiosity into students. However, the process of teaching computer science in a standard curriculum is surprisingly uncommon. If a school does teach computer science at all, it is only taught at an AP level in late high school.

To slim the odds even more, only about 5% of U.S. high schools even offer an AP Computer Science course\*. The untapped potential of these students prevents ubiquitous computing from growing as quickly as it could. For this reason, simple activities in engineering allow for students to generate their own interest in the subject.

#### The Solution

Robo-Student was developed to address this issue. Robo-Student defines a guidebook of teachable exercises that a teacher might use to educate his or her students on several principles of computer science. 

My team worked with an elementary school in Indonesia to test the viability and scaling of the proposed system. We working with the teachers of several grades of schoolchildren and  saw a fairly respectable return in learned behavior. Near the end of the program, the number of corrections to the childrens solutions had been greatly reduced.
