  intro: |
    Allergen immunotherapy treatment has always required frequent documentation of symptoms, resulting in a small mountain of paper. MyAllergyPal is an application that helps patients track their medication progress, check allergens in their city, and browse allergen sources relevant to their life. The application was a result of collaboration between myself and the other interns at The BHW Group. 
  long: |
    Patients at allergy clinics are able to take injections at home as they complete allergen immunotherapy, allowing them to live free of worries from many common allergies. With MyAllergyPal, patients can record each entry of their treatment without the need to worry about paper records. The application itself was built using React Native, a mobile development framework that uses Javascript and React, resulting in simple, cross-platform support.

    Over the course of the project, I worked with a small team of interns at The BHW Group to program the cross-platform application using React Native. Under the tutelage of their seasoned developers, I got to experience the usage of several commonly used developer tools in the workplace.

    The application has been released and is currently in service through Google Play and the Apple Store.
