    Hackathon (Hack-a-thon): an event, typically lasting several days, in which a large number of people meet to engage in collaborative computer programming.

    In 2014, I helped to found HackDFW with a couple of college friends. Now, it has become one of the most successful hackathon planning organizations in the United States.

It started out as a pipe dream, but we worked at it enough to turn it into an unforgettable weekend experience. 

We found company sponsors, bought T-shirts, and made friends with the local RedBull supplier. 

We implanted internet into the entirety of the Texas State Fair Grounds. We even got Mark Cuban to judge.

And then we iterated for the next four years.

I love computer science, so much that I want to help others to love it, as well. A hackathon presents an environment for people to do just that with the help of cutting-edge technology, a big group of friends, and a ludicrous amount of caffeine.

Myself and a group of friends helped to develop and grow the 501 (c) (3) into the organization that it is today. We've reached tens of thousands of participants, brought in enthusiasts from around the globe, and helped to bring life to an innumerable amount of projects surrounding any topic you could imagine.

Due to the entrepreneurial nature of the organization, I have been able to contribute in a variety of ways towards growth and development. I've designed experiences, assisted in creating graphics, and spearheaded business development for company longetivity.
