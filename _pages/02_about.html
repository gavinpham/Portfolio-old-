		My name is Gavin Pham, and I am some kind of whacky hybridization between a computer scientist and a human-centered designer.

	<div class="about-cascade-entry hidden"">
		Over the past couple of years,  have been honing my skills as a design researcher within the <a href="http://www.smumadi.com/">Masters of Arts in Design and Innovation</a> program at Southern Methodist Univeristy. I have conducted hundreds of research interviews, written a ludicrous amount of sticky notes, and prototyped some really awesome ideas.

		My second love is devoted to coding and computer science. I received my Bachelor's in Computer Science at SMU in May of 2017. I cofounded <a href="https://www.hackdfw.com/">HackDFW</a>, one of the largest hackathon organizations in the United States.

		When the situation allows it, I will nerd out on sorting efficiency and optimization. That's why all of the animations on this site are written in CSS.
	</div>
	<br>
	<div class="about-cascade-entry hidden"">
		These two areas of interest, human centered design and computer science, occasionally intersect. That is where I find my happy place.
