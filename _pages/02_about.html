			My name is Gavin Pham, and I am some kind of whacky hybridization between a computer scientist and a human-centered designer. <br><br>Over the past couple of years,  have been honing my skills as a design researcher within the <a href="http://www.smumadi.com/">Masters of Arts in Design and Innovation</a> program at SMU. I have conducted hundreds of research interviews, written a ludicrous amount of sticky notes, and prototyped some really awesome ideas.

			My second love is devoted to coding and computer science. I received my Bachelor's in Computer Science at SMU in May of 2017. <br><br>I cofounded <a href="https://www.hackdfw.com/">HackDFW</a>, one of the largest hackathon organizations in the United States. <br><br>When the situation allows it, I will nerd out on sorting efficiency and optimization. That's why most of the animations on this site are written in CSS.

	<div class="flex-1">
			These two areas of interest, human centered design and computer science, occasionally intersect. I never try to force it, but sometimes prototyping calls for scripting or some programmatic solution. <br><br>That is where I find my happy place.
