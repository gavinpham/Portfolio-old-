***My name is Gavin Pham, I'm some kind of whacky hybridization between a computer scientist and a human centered designer.***

Over the past couple of years, I have been honing my skills as a design researcher within the [Masters of Arts in Design and Innovation](http://www.smumadi.com/) program at SMU. I have conducted hundreds of research interviews, written a ludicrous amount of sticky notes, and prototyped some really awesome ideas. 

My second love is devoted to coding and computer science. I received my Bachelor's in Computer Science at SMU in May of 2017. I cofounded [HackDFW](https://www.hackdfw.com/), one of the largest hackathon organizations in the United States. When the situation allows it, I will nerd out on sorting efficiency and optimization. (*That's why most of the animations on this site are written in CSS.*)

These two areas of interest, human centered design and computer science, occasionally intersect. I never try to force it, but sometimes prototyping calls for scripting or some programmatic solution. That is where I find my happy place.
